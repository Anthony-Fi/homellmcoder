# HomeLLMCoder User Guide

Welcome to HomeLLMCoder! This guide will help you get started with the application.

## Setting Up Your Project

1.  **Launch the application.**
2.  Use the **File Navigator** on the left to browse to your project's folder.
3.  **Right-click** on your project's root folder and select **"Set as Project Root"**. This tells HomeLLMCoder where your project is located.

## Using the Agentic Workflow

HomeLLMCoder uses a team of specialized AI agents to help you with your coding tasks. Here's how to use them:

1.  **Select the Manager Agent:** In the chat panel, use the dropdown menu to select the `Manager Agent`.
2.  **Give the Manager a Goal:** In the chat input, describe the high-level goal for your project. For example: `Create a simple Python web server using Flask.`
3.  **Review the Plan:** The Manager will create a `plan.md` file in your project's root directory. This file outlines the project and the tasks required to complete it. You can open this file in the editor to see the plan.
4.  **Switch to the Planner Agent:** Once the plan is created, switch to the `Planner Agent`. The Planner will read the `plan.md` and provide a detailed, step-by-step guide to completing the tasks.
5.  **Execute with Specialist Agents:** Use the other specialist agents, like the `Coder Agent` or `Docs Agent`, to execute the steps provided by the Planner.

## Chatting with the AI

-   **Select a Model:** Use the dropdown menu at the top of the chat panel to select the LLM you want to use.
-   **Enter Your Prompt:** Type your message in the input box at the bottom and press Enter.
-   **View the Conversation:** The conversation is displayed in the main chat area, with your messages on the right and the AI's responses on the left.
