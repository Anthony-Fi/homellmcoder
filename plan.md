# Project Plan: [Project Name]

## 1. Project Goal & Vision

*   **High-Level Goal:** (A one-sentence summary of what this project aims to achieve. e.g., "Create a web-based chat application using Flask and WebSockets.")
*   **Core Problem:** (What problem is this project solving?)
*   **Target User:** (Who is this project for?)
*   **Key Features:**
    *   [ ] Feature 1 (e.g., Real-time messaging)
    *   [ ] Feature 2 (e.g., User authentication)
    *   [ ] Feature 3 (e.g., Chat history)

## 2. Architecture & Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript - No framework)
*   **Backend:** (e.g., Python, Flask, Flask-SocketIO)
*   **Database:** (e.g., SQLite for simplicity)
*   **Deployment:** (e.g., Local development server)
*   **Testing:** (e.g., Pytest for backend unit tests)

## 3. Task Breakdown (Milestones)

This plan will be executed step-by-step. Completed tasks will be marked with `[x]`.

### Milestone 1: Project Setup & "Hello World"

*   [ ] Create project directory structure (`/app`, `/static`, `/templates`).
*   [ ] Initialize `requirements.txt` with `Flask` and `Flask-SocketIO`.
*   [ ] Create a basic Flask app (`app.py`) that serves a "Hello World" `index.html`.
*   [ ] Create a basic `index.html` file.
*   [ ] **Test:** Run the Flask server and ensure "Hello World" is visible in the browser.

### Milestone 2: Basic Chat Functionality

*   [ ] Implement WebSocket connection on the server.
*   [ ] Implement WebSocket connection on the client-side JavaScript.
*   [ ] Create a simple UI with a message input box and a send button.
*   [ ] Implement logic to broadcast messages from one client to all other clients.
*   [ ] **Test:** Open two browser windows and confirm that messages sent from one appear in the other.

### Milestone 3: [Next Milestone Title]

*   [ ] Task 1
*   [ ] Task 2
*   [ ] **Test:** (How to verify this milestone is complete?)

## 4. Future Improvements & Ideas

*   (e.g., User profiles)
*   (e.g., Private messaging)
*   (e.g., Nicer UI styling)
